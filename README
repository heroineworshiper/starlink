What you'll find here:

Starlink router replica for a raspberry pi case.


starlink.FCStd: the master model for freecad
starlink.3mf: the cura file with the right orientations & settings

It is printed in an orientation which gives a simulated brushed metal on
all the sides

starlink2.FCStd: 3 sided enclosure very loosely based on the starlink 2
router



TODO:

Tabs for making the corners stay together.  The printing process
tends to warp the corners.

Stand.

LED hole.

Grey/white segments made out of different colors
